graph1.txt, 3 colors: Unsatisfiable
graph1.txt, 4 colors: Satisfiable

This tells us that the minimum amount of edges for all
nodes within the graph is 3. This is derived from the
minimum amount of colors needed to solve the graph and
subtracting one for the minimum edge count.

The following is a viable solution:
1 - Red
2 - Blue
3 - Green
4 - Yellow

Node 1 - Yellow
Node 2 - Red
Node 3 - Yellow
Node 4 - Green
Node 5 - Red
Node 6 - Blue
Node 7 - Green

For graph2.txt, the minimum amount of colors needed to solve the
graph would be 8 colors, anything less than that would be
unsatisfiable
